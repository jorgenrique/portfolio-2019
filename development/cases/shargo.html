                <h5>Journey</h5>
                <p>Shargo is a logistics start up that focus in express delivery, via a platform that has been designed and developed to suit retailers delivery needs. I first started working for them as a freelance front end developer, my task was to implement a new payment flow. While I was working on it, there were some UX flow issues that I raised with the Chief Design Officer, and after fixing those and finishing the task I was hired to, they offered me a role as an UX consultant and freelance front end developer.</p>
                <p>Our collaboration ended when they got bought, and the new investors changed the whole team.</p>

                <h5>Contribution</h5>
                <p>While I was there I was working side by side with the CDO and CTO. As mentioned before, I was doing both front ent development and UX flow consultancy.</p>
                <p>During my period there, I worked on 2 main projects:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature job">
                <h4>Admin interface for retailers to request a service</h4>
                <div class="image shadow"><img src="../img/shargo_admin.png" alt="Shargo"></div>
                <p>The main goal for this project was to improve the flow for booking a service. A lot of the main users were old people, which means there was a big contrast challenge we needed to tackle. The company CVI had been decided with yellow on white, which didn't help much with the contrast. We had to then increase the size of all the elements, and have them all together in a sequence, to facilitate users to achieve their goal. This simple change improved conversion in more than 10%.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature job">
                <h4>Redesign and develop the customer facing website</h4>
                <div class="image shadow"><img src="../img/shargo_web.png" alt="Shargo"></div>
                <p>The goal for this project was to increase the number of new clients. Being the first impression for new clients, it had to be very clear and appealing. We focused the concept on generating trust, mainly by logos using us and testimonials, and by explaining the service in a very simple and straightforward way.</p>
