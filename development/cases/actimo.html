            <h5>Journey</h5>
            <p>Actimo is a SAAS, B2B HR platform, where enterprise companies can create their intranet mobile apps for employee communication, training and leadership. I joined them as the first designer ever in the company. They brought me in because they acknowledged the big UX flows and consistency issues they had. They were also in the process of completing the product's 1st stage, which means there were also new features that had to be designed.</p>
            <p>As the team grew, the tech team divided into 2 squads, and I became the lead for one of them. Besides the regular product designer tasks, I also had product management tasks, such as feature prioritization, project development, communication about the project status, documentation, release planning etc.</p>
            <p>After 2.5 years in the same job, I felt like I needed a change in my life, and that's why my cycle with Actimo came to an end. In that time, the design team grew to have 3 designers (2 product, 1 marketing), the number of active users per week was more than doubled (Product main KPI) and the ARR was also more than doubled (Company wide KPI).</p>

            <h5>Contribution</h5>
            <p>As the first designer, I introduced data based design decisions, crossing qualitative data from interviews made to existing clients and quantitative data taken from the platform usage to make smarter decisions about new features and improvements.</p>
            <p>My focus on user research pushed operations to create a client testing group, where we could reach out to the clients that were part of it to test new features or improvements.</p>
            <p>When I started, there was already a defined CVI that had been done by an external agency. Nevertheless, I made the interface lighter, going from a dark blue background to a white one, giving elements space to breathe and making it more pleasant for users to look. Also, created a UI kit and laid the foundations for a design system.</p>
            <p>My work was focused on 4 main different areas:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature job">
            <h4>Employee engagement</h4>
            <div class="image"><img src="../img/actimo_1.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>Engagement was one of the main KPIs the product team had, so I was always optimizing features or creating new ones to improve it. Most of the employee facing features came with nudging elements that were designed to improve weekly active users. This metric was raised to more than double during the time I was there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature job">
            <h4>Content creation</h4>
            <div class="image shadow"><img src="../img/actimo_2.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>In order for a company to have engaged and recurring employees, new content should be created constantly (hooked theory). As a SAAS business, we couldn't create content for every client, but we could facilitate the creation of it. That's why also a big part of my efforts were focused on improving flows for different kind of content creation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature job">
            <h4>Employee performance</h4>
            <div class="image video shadow">
                <iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mBbWE-G1ZjY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>I was also responsible for developing a dashboard where all app usage information was displayed. This helped me massively improve my data visualization skills, as it had never done before in the company, so had to design the dashboard from scratch. It was one of the biggest projects and the one that generated the best  impact in the NPS.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature job">
            <h4>Leadership tools</h4>
            <div class="image"><img src="../img/actimo_4.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>The lead pillar was the last one to be introduced as part of Actimo's market fit strategy, and it's main goal was to complement the communication and training parts of the platform. As a part of this, I developed a pulse surveys tool, a one on one facilitator tool, and a section where managers would have an overview of their employees's performance.</p>
