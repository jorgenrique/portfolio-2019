                <h5>Journey</h5>
                <p>BeeTheData offers innovative software solutions in the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I first worked for them as a contractor, as I built the MVP for their star product, Beeye - aimed at performing face recognition, both for security and marketing purposes. It uses state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to analyze both real time camera feeds and recorded videos.</p>
                <p>After they raised â‚¬1M seed capital, they created the company and hired me as a Product lead. I was responsible for the design and front-end development of the products that would be created.</p>
                <p>After 3 products and having hired 4 people (1 designer, 3 developers), I decided to take the chance and move to Copenhagen, where I took a job offer from Actimo.</p>

                <h5>Contribution</h5>
                <p>As the product lead, I  developed a design system for all the interfaces we'd make. Each product had their main color, but the structure would be similar. This would ramp up development times, and would help the team replicate code and maximize resources.</p>

                <p>This allowed us to develop 1 product and 2 MVPs in 6 months:</p>
